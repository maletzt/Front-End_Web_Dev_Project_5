Front-End Web Development Project 5 - Neighborhood Map Project
===============================

**Goal of the Project:**

* To develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. Add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. As well as research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

**About the application**

* This is a neighborhood map that provides things to do with your dog in the Duluth, GA area. It utilizes Google Maps, Google Geocoder, Google Streetview, and Foursquare API to provide the detail in the application. It will also provide a hyperlink to the locations webpage if one is available from Foursquare. You can select a location provided in the list to the left, which will pan to the marker on the map with additional information presented in an infowindow. You may also filter your results by typing the name of the location in the filter list section.

**How to use the applicaton**

* You may download the zip file and then open the index.html in your preferred web brower.
